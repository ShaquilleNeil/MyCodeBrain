This repository contains solutions to programming problems completed as part of my daily practice and learning routine.

The goal of this repo is **not just to solve problems**, but to document **how I think about them**, how I handle edge cases, and how my approach improves over time across different languages.

---

## Purpose

- Practice core programming concepts (logic, control flow, data types)
- Strengthen problem-solving skills across multiple languages
- Build the habit of finishing, reviewing, and documenting solutions
- Create a visible timeline of learning and improvement

This repository reflects **final, corrected solutions**, not first drafts.

---

## Languages Used

Problems may be solved in one or more of the following:

- JavaScript  
- Swift / SwiftUI  
- Java  
- .NET MAUI (C#)  

Each solution focuses on writing **clear, readable, and intentional code**, rather than overly clever shortcuts.

---

## Structure

Problems are organized by day or concept.  
File names are descriptive and indicate what the problem focuses on.

Examples:
- `fizzbuzz-validation.js`
- `input-normalization.swift`
- `conditional-logic.cs`

Some files may include short comments explaining:
- The main idea of the problem
- Common pitfalls
- What the solution is meant to demonstrate

---

## Approach

For each problem, I aim to:

1. Normalize input early
2. Validate explicitly (no guessing, no hidden coercion)
3. Keep logic pure and predictable
4. Return consistent types
5. Prefer clarity over cleverness

When applicable, constraints (such as “no if statements” or “expression-only solutions”) are respected to deepen understanding.

---

## Notes

- This repo is a **learning log**, not a library.
- Solutions may evolve as understanding improves.
- Earlier problems may be revisited and refined.

---

## Status

Active and ongoing.

New problems are added regularly as part of daily practice.
